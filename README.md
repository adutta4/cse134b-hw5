# CSE 134B - HW 5
Old HTML and CSS files were removed and unused code was pruned. For the education section, a new button was added in order to dynamically add a column specifying course details.
This is to help the interactivity of the otherwise static page, and make it more user-friendly (details take up a lot of space, and the page looks cleaner without inclusion in case this
is desired by the user). The CSS of this page was also significantly improved, providing a more streamlined and less cluttered view. Finally, the dark/light themes were amended to include
both the new experiences page (with project-cards), and the improved education page.
